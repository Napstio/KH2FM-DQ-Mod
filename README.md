A Dragon Quest Mod for Kingdom Hearts 2 replace some of the game's character by DQ character
as I advanced on that project my motivation was... variable, so the quality of model porting is variable too


thanks to Mike9k1 who ripped Eight's model from the mobile version of DQVIII

thanks Vierock for the PS2 HD texture pack

thanks Magic Banana for the 3DS HD texture pack

thanks Joschuka for his Noesis plugging for DQ Rival Ace's model

thanks nubnoobsly for his T-posed version of Sofia's model
